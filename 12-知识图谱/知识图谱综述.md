本文内容：

- **Comprehensive review.** We conduct a comprehensive review on the origin of knowledge graph and modern techniques for relational learning on knowledge graphs. Major neural architectures of knowledge graph representation learning and reasoning are introduced and compared. Moreover, we provide a complete overview of many applications on different domains.

- **Full-view categorization and new taxonomies.** A full-view categorization of research on knowledge graph, together with fine-grained new taxonomies are presented. 

  Specifically, in the high-level we review knowledge graph in three aspects: KRL, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge-aware application. 

  - For KRL approaches, we further propose fine-grained taxonomies into four views including representa tion space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information. 
  - For knowledge acquisition, KGC is reviewed under embedding-based ranking, relational path reasoning, logical rule reasoning and meta relational learning; entity-relation acquisition tasks are divided into entity recognition, typing, disambiguation, and alignment; and relation extraction is discussed according to the neural paradigms.

- **Wide coverage on emerging advances.** This survey provides a wide coverage on emerging topics including transformer-based knowledge encoding, graph neural network (GNN) based knowledge prop- agation, reinforcement learning based path reasoning, and meta relational learning.

- **Summary and outlook on future directions.** This survey provides a summary on each category and highlights promising future research directions.
